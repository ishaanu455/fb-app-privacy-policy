Last updated: January 2026

## Introduction
This application is used to automate video uploads from a local directory to a Facebook Page via the Meta Graph API.

## Data Collection
Our application does not collect, store, or share any personal user data. It only accesses the Facebook Page specifically authorized by the user to upload video content.

## Data Usage
The Page Access Token is used locally on the user's machine to facilitate the video upload process. No data is sent to third parties other than Meta/Facebook.

## Data Deletion
Since we do not store your data on any external servers, you can "delete" your data by simply removing the App's permissions in your Facebook "Business Integrations" settings.
